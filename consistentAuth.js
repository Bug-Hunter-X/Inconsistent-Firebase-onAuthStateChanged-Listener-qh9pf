To handle inconsistencies in `onAuthStateChanged`, implement more robust error handling and potentially incorporate retry mechanisms. Consider using a combination of techniques such as:

1. **State management:** Employ a dedicated state management solution (e.g., Redux, Zustand) to manage the authentication state and ensure UI updates happen reliably from the single source of truth.
2. **Exponential backoff:** If the listener fails to update, retry after exponentially increasing delays. This helps avoid overwhelming the Firebase service during temporary network issues.
3. **Error handling:** Implement proper error handling to gracefully deal with Firebase errors and prevent the app from crashing. Consider logging errors and providing informative user feedback.
4. **Polling (as a last resort):** As a last resort, consider polling the authentication status periodically in the case of consistent failures. This is less efficient than real-time listeners but can provide a fallback mechanism.

**Example (using exponential backoff):**

```javascript
let retryCount = 0;
firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
  // ... your existing code ...
}, (error) => {
  const delay = Math.pow(2, retryCount) * 1000; // Exponential backoff
  retryCount++;
  setTimeout(() => {
    firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
      // ... your code ...
    }, error => { /* Handle the error */ });
  }, delay);
});
```

Remember to adjust the exponential backoff strategy according to your needs.
